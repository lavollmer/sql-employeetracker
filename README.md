This project was done in conjunction with the U of MN Bootcamp 2023. 

U of MN tutoring services were used to assist with this homework. The tutor and myself discussed overall logic to complete the homework such as case/switch statements, inquirer.prompt, table package and connection.js files. Code was provided for connection.js by tutor; however, I used my own code after discussion. 

Case and switch logic was inspired by : https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_switch.asp

Table package: https://www.npmjs.com/package/console-table-printer

Rawlist Code: https://www.npmjs.com/package/prompt-rawlist

AskBCS was used to figure out the connection.js file with a Mac computer.
